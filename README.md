## Notes for Development

Development page is being worked out on the 'Dev' branch.

Add blog posts, video posts, event posts to the respective .js files in ./data like the templates. Use JSX instead of strings if you want.

Because of ReactJS, you'll need to create a local server to perview the website while working.

#### Frameworks being used
- ReactJS
- JQuery
- Bootstrap

Great opensource tools for development:
- [Brackets IDE](http://brackets.io/)
- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com)
- [Atom](https://atom.io)
